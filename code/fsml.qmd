FSML is a modern Fortran statistics and machine learning library suitable for contemporary research problems and teaching. It includes procedures for basic statistics, hypothesis tests, linear and non-linear methods, and statistical distribution functions. The source code (incl. examples and documentation) is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastian-mutz/fsml).

# Software Description

## Scope

FSML consists of a set of accessible and well-documented statistics and ML procedures, suitable for many contemporary research problems and teaching. These procedures are categorised into five thematic modules:

- DST: Statistical distribution functions (e.g., the probability density, cumulative distribution, and quantile functions of the Student’s t and generalised Pareto distributions).
- STS: Basic statistics for describing and understanding data (e.g., mean, variance, correlation).
- TST: Parametric and non-parametric hypothesis tests (e.g., analysis of variance, Mann–Whitney U).
- LIN: Statistical procedures relying heavily on linear algebra (e.g., principal component analysis, ridge regression, linear discriminant analysis).
- NLP: Non-linear and algorithmic procedures (e.g., k-means clustering).

FSML has minimal requirements. It uses Fortran 2008 features, Fortran-lang stdlib for linear algebra, and fpm for easy building and distribution.

## Documentation

The FSML handbook is hosted on [fsml.mutz.science](https://fsml.mutz.science/) and can be re-generated from its source files. It includes a detailed, example-rich documentation of the covered procedures, as well as installation instructions and information for contributors.

# Examples

The examples below demonstrate the use of FSML interfaces, using double precision (dp):

* statistical distribution functions:
```fortran
  ! exponential distribution probability density function
  ! with x=0.8 and lambda=0.5
  fx = fsml_exp_pdf(0.8_dp, lambda=0.5_dp)
  ! generalised Pareto cumulative distribution function
  ! with modified shape (xi) and location (mu) parameters
  fx = fsml_gpd_cdf(1.9_dp, xi=1.2_dp, mu=0.6_dp)
```

* sample statistics and dependency measures:
```fortran
  ! mean of vector x
  mean = fsml_mean(x)
  ! sample standard deviation of vector x
  std = fsml_std(x, ddf=1.0_dp)
  ! Pearson correlation coefficient for vectors x1 and x2
  pcc = fsml_pcc(x1, x2)
```

* hypothesis tests:
```fortran
  ! two-sample t-test for unequal variances (Welch's t-test);
  ! returns test statistic (t), degrees of freedom (df), and p
  call fsml_ttest_2sample(x1, x2, t, df, p, eq_var=.false.)
  ! one-way ANOVA on a rank-2 array (x2d);
  ! returns f-statistic (f), degrees of freedom (df1, df2) and p
  call fsml_anova_1way(x2d, f, df1, df2, p)
```

* multiple linear ridge regression:
```fortran
  ! ridge regression for 100 data points, 5 variables, and lambda=0.2;
  ! returns y intercept (b0), regression coefficients (b), and R^2 (rsq)
  call fsml_ridge(x, y, 100, 5, 0.2_dp, b0, b, rsq)
```

FSML's repository and handbook includes examples for every public interface.

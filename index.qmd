I'm a computational climatologist ([associate professor](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/staff/sebastianmutz/) at the University of Glasgow). I use theory- and data-driven models to understand and predict processes and events in the climate system. I currently serve as manager of [ExaGEO](https://www.exageo.org/) (exascale computing for environmental solutions), on the steering committee of the [ESM-AI](https://sages.ac.uk/research/fora/earth-system-modelling-artificial-intelligence-esm-ai/) (Earth System Modelling and Artificial Intelligence) forum of SAGES (Scottish Alliance for Geoscience, Environment and Society), and on the [EGU-OC](https://www.egu.eu/outreach/) (European Geosciences Union Outreach Committee).

# Climate Dynamics Lab

The [Climate Dynamics Lab](https://mutz.science/) is a small, international network of scientists working on different aspects of climate dynamics and climate change impact prediction. We keep an open-door policy to anyone interested in working on these topics (as a researcher, developer or communicator). [Get in touch](mailto:sebastian@mutz.science) if you have questions, comments, or would like to join us!

**Uncertainty, chance, and chaos** -- these are concepts we associate with difficult decisions, existential questions, and perhaps anxiousness. They are with us everyday and stay with us for our entire lives. Yet any serious engagement with these topics quickly leads us deep into a confusing world of philosophy and mathematics. The aim of this post is to discuss these topics in an accessible and practical way, to cover some mathematics without mathematics™, and philosophy without philosophy™, acknowledging that it sacrifices nuance for greater accessibility to the topics.

# Probability -- a measure for uncertainty

In history, people have started their journey of understanding something by trying to measure it, describing it mathematically, putting some numbers on it. This is where we'll start, too.

| Physical Space | Uncertainty |
| :--: | :--: |
| ![](img/box.png){width="50%"} | ![](img/question.png){width="50%"} |
| -- | -- |
| ![](img/ruler.png){width="50%"} | Probability |

Imagine a box. We can measure its length along one dimension, we can measure its area if we use 2 dimensions, and measure its volume if we use all 3 dimensions of physical space. These measures can be generalised as the Lebesgue measure. The Lebesgue measure is the generalised way to measure subsets of Euclidean $n$-spaces. For $n=1$, it is length, for $n=2$, it is area, and for $n=3$, it is volume. Even if you weren't familiar with these terms, you were familiar with the basic concepts of measuring length, area, and volume. Just like the Lebesgue measure lets us measure Euclidean space, probability provides a measure for uncertainty. However, probability ($P$) is unitless and always in the range $0 \le P \le 1$.

**Ok, so we can measure uncertainty, but what is it and where it comes from?**

Our observations of the world around us are always incomplete, filtered through our limited senses and cognitive biases, and often poorly understood and severely misinterpreted by us. This is a large source of uncertainty already. To complicate things further, there are things that are simply random and thus not predictable even if our observations were complete and we had the cognitive ability to process and understand them all. Let's look at these types of uncertainty more closely and learn how to describe them.


# Sources of uncertainty

## What sights to see?

Imagine the following scenario: You are planning a trip with your best friend. You've narrowed down the places and sights you want to see to: 1) the southern shores of Caspian Sea in Iran, 2) the dark forests of the Fichtel Mountains, 3) modern day dinosaurs (pigeons) in Glasgow. You decide to let a roll of dice make the decision for you.

Your friend suggests rolling a set of perfectly balanced dice and pick your destination based on the outcome.
You already have some dice on hand (as ones does). They're not perfectly balanced, but you don't have to get them first, and they look way cooler anyway.
Your friend doesn't like unfair dice and jokingly suggests: "We may as well just ask my friend Thor and let him decide with his chaos magic".

Well, that escalated quickly. However, these range of options allow us to explore different types of **uncertainty** and **probability**. Let's go through them step-by-step.

### 1. Perfect dice, randomness, and objective probabilities

::: {.column width="70%"}
By design, the outcome of a roll of a perfect die is meant to be **random**, i.e. governed by **chance**. If we accept this premise, then the outcome of a die roll will change even if we apply the exact same force when rolling in the exact same environmental conditions. The uncertainty of the outcome is **aleatory uncertainty** - uncertainty that arises due to randomness. This uncertainty is usually described with so-called **objective probabilities**.

### 2. Cool dice, ignorance, and subjective probabilities

::: {.column width="70%"}

Unbalanced dice will bias the outcome of a roll towards one or several sides on the dice. If we put in some effort, we could determine this bias through experimentation. Then, the outcome of a roll would be more predictable than it is in case of the perfect dice. The bias is knowable, and the uncertainty in outcomes could be reduced if we learned this knowledge. When uncertainty arises due to our ignorance or lack of knowledge (rather than randomness), we speak of **epistemic uncertainties**. This uncertainty is usually described with so-called **subjective probabilities**. Subjective does not imply a lack of rigour; it simply depends on the state of knowledge of a subject. It describes our "degree of belief", given the information we have.

### 3. Thor's chaos magic

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/thor2.jpg){width="80%" style="border-radius:4px;"}

::: {.column width="70%"}

This option is similar to option 2 in that a lot of uncertainty arises due to a lack of knowledge. However, it is a more extreme case, as there are a lot more knowable unknowns. Will you remember to contact Thor? Will he read the message? Will he agree to this strange request? Will he use his chaos magic or tell you whatever first comes to his mind? Will he inform you of the outcome or forget about it as he gets lost in his awesome music projects? Even though many of these things are knowable, **we simply don't know**.

# Unpredictability

In the section above, we learned that the uncertainty associated with event outcomes can arise from the inherent randomness of a process or our lack of knowledge about a process. Or both. By extension, we can say that our ability to predict that outcome is limited the same. If we could attribute our difficulties to predict a process to inherent randomness, the case would be simple. We would be forced into radical acceptance of this unpredictability. However, in *real life*, we usually cannot know if our uncertainty can be attributed to true randomness, because we don't know enough about the processes. So epistemic uncertainty (ignorance) precludes attribution to aleatory uncertainty (randomness).


## Laplace's demon

Laplace's demon is a hypothetical being proposed by the mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace. It helps us understand the concept of epistemic uncertainty and subjective probabilities better. The idea: A demon who knows everything in existence at all time would be able to predict every event outcome perfectly. Such would be possible only if true randomness did not exist. At the time Laplace proposed this, true randomness had not been demonstrated convincingly. This has changed, which caused many to quickly dismiss this concept. Personally, I think people are keen to dismiss this notion because of the implication it would have on the much valued belief in free will. However, it remains unclear how much true randomness actually plays a role on scales relevant to *real life* problems.


## The butterfly effect

The **butterfly effect** is often described through a hypothetical scenario, in which the flaps of a butterfly's wings have strong impacts on the weather elsewhere in the world. It describes the high sensitivity of a **deterministic** system (in this case the weather system) to changes in its initial conditions. Since we have no way of knowing the exact initial conditions, the effect leads to unpredictability. Note that we speak of deterministic systems, i.e. systems that involve no randomness, so the unpredictability stems from a lack of knowledge rather than processes goverened by chance. In other words: Laplace's demon would be able to predict this change in weather! We speak of **chaos** when describing the unpredictable and seemingly random (but not truly random) behaviour of deterministic systems.


## Chance or chaos? Does it matter?

Let's leave the realm of mathematics and think about decision making in face of uncertainty and (un)predictability). In many practical cases, we cannot tell if a process is unpredictable because it is truly random (governed by chance) or chaotic and unpredictable because we simply lack a of knowledge. If the understanding or predictability is far outside our current reach, we can treat the latter as "random for practical purposes".

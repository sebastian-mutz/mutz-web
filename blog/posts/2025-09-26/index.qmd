**Uncertainty, chance, and chaos** -- these are concepts we associate with difficult decisions, existential questions, and perhaps anxiousness. They are with us everyday and stay with us for our entire lives. Yet any serious engagement with these topics quickly leads us deep into a confusing world of philosophy and mathematics. The aim of this post is to discuss these topics in an accessible and practical way, to cover some mathematics without mathematics™, and philosophy without philosophy™ .

# Probability -- a measure for uncertainty

In history, people have started their journey of understanding something by trying to measure it, describing it mathematically, putting some numbers on it. This is where we'll start, too.

| Physical Space | Uncertainty |
| :--: | :--: |
| ![](img/box.png){width="50%"} | ![](img/question.png){width="50%"} |
| -- | -- |
| ![](img/ruler.png){width="50%"} | Probability |

Imagine a box. We can measure its length along one dimension, we can measure its area if we use 2 dimensions, and measure its volume if we use all 3 dimensions of physical scpace. These measures can be generalised as the Lebesgue measure. The Lebesgue measure is the generalised way to measure subsets of Euclidean $n$-spaces. For $n=1$, it is length, for $n=2$, it is area, and for $n=3$, it is volume. Even if you weren't familiar with these terms, you were familiar with the basic concepts of measuring length, area, and volume. Just like the Lebesgue measure lets us measure Euclidean space, probability provides a measure for uncertainty. However, probability ($P$) is unitless and always in the range $0.0 \leq P \leq 1.0$.

**Ok, so we can measure uncertainty, but what is it and where it comes from?**

Our observations of the world around us are always incomplete, filtered through our limited senses and cognitive biases, and often poorly understood and severely misinterpreted by us. This is a large source of uncertainty already. To complicate things further, there are things that are simply random and thus not predictable even if our observations were complete and we had the cognitive ability to process and understand them all. Let's look at these types of uncertainty more closely and learn how to describe them.

# Chance or chaos?


## What sights to see?

Imagine the following scenario: You are planning a trip with your best friend. You're narrowed down the places and sights you want to see to: 1) the southern shores of Caspian Sea in Iran, 2) the dark forests of the Fichtel Mountains, 3) modern day dinosaurs in Glasgow. You decide to let a roll of dice make the decision for you.

Your friend suggests rolling a set of perfectly balanced dice and pick your destination based on the outcome.
You already have some dice on hand (as ones does). They're not perfectly balanced, but you don't have to get them first, and they look way cooler anyway.
Your friend doesn't like unfair dice and jokingly suggests: "We may as well just ask my friend Thor and let him decide with his chaos magic".

Well, that escalated quickly. However, these range of options allow us to explore different types of **uncertainty** and **probability**. Let's go through them step-by-step.

### 1. Perfect dice, randomness, and objective probabilities

::: {.column width="70%"}
By design, the outcome of a roll of perfect dice is meant to be **random**, i.e. governed by **chance**. If we accept this premise, then the outcome of a dice roll will change even if we apply the exact same force when rolling in the exact same environmental conditions. The uncertainty of the outcome is **aleatory uncertainty** - uncertainty that arises due to randomness. This uncertainty is usually described with so-called **objective probabilities**.

### 2. Cool dice, ignorance, and subjective probabilities

::: columns

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/die2.jpg){width="80%" style="border-radius:4px;"}
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

Unbalanced dice will bias the outcome of a roll towards one or several sides on the dice. If we put in some effort, we could determine this bias through experimentation. Then, the outcome of a roll would be more predictable than it is in case of the perfect dice. The bias is knowable, and the uncertainty in outcomes could be reduced if we learned this knowledge. When uncertainty arises due to our ignorance or lack of knowledge (rather than randomness), we speak of **epistemic uncertainties**. This uncertainty is usually described with so-called **subjective probabilities**. Subective does not imply a lack of rigour; it simply depends on the state of knowledge of a subject. It describes our "degree of belief", given the information we have.

### 3. Thor's chaos magic

::: columns

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/thor2.jpg){width="80%" style="border-radius:4px;"}
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

This option is similar to option 2 in that a lot of uncertainty arises due to a lack of knowledge. However, it is a more extreme case, as there are a lot more knowable unknowns. Will you remember to contact Thor? Will he read the message? Will he agree to this strange request? Will he use his chaos magic or tell you whatever first comes to his mind? Will he inform you of the outcome or forget about it as he gets lost in his awesome music projects? Even though many of these things are knowable, **we simply don't know**.

## Laplace's demon


## Random for all practical purposes

In many practical cases, we cannot tell if a process is unpredictable because it is truly random or unpredictable because we simply lack a lot of knowledge about it. If that understanding is far outside our current reach, we can treat the latter as "random for practical purposes".

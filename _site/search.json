    "text": "Everyday uncertainty\nProbability is a mathematical measure for uncertainty. That sounds simple enough, but if you aren’t a mathematician (perhaps even if you are), browsing a list of mathematical measures will soon have you scratching your head. Most other measures will seem rather abstract.\nSo why do many of us feel that we have a good intuitive grasp on probability?\nA quick word search on Google Books Ngram Viewer, a tool that lets you plot the frequency of the yearly count of words (or n-grams to be specific) found in Google’s text corpora, can give us an idea of how often probability-themed words are used. Here, we’re comparing “probability”, “chance”, and “likely” to common words like “goodbye”, “bird”, and “woman”.\n\n\n\nSmoothed, yearly word count for probability-related words and common probability-unrelated words, as found in Google’s text corpora. (Source: Google Books Ngram Viewer.)\n\n\nThis is no accurate representation of our daily conversations and thoughts, of course, but it is a good-enough measure to demonstrate how prevalent this concept of probability and uncertainty generally is. This is no surprise, given that every observation we make is incomplete and, consequently, comes with uncertainty. Therefore, every decision based on these incomplete observations is a decision made under uncertainty. A sense – or measure – of this uncertainty allows us to deal with it more confidently. Perhaps our daily use of some interpretation of probability gives us confidence in our intuitive grasp of the mathematical concept. Perhaps it comes from somewhere else. Regardless, it is often a wild overestimation of our ability to understand probability."

    "section": "A game of dice",
    "text": "A game of dice\nProbability isn’t intuitive – this is a point I always make at the beginning of my series of lectures on statistics and probability theory. A few years ago, I invested in a (supposedly) perfectly balanced and fair d20 – that’s a 20 sided die (for those of you who haven’t played classic pen-and-paper role-playing games). I sometimes roll it and record the outcomes, because it relaxes me. I have no life, I know – but at least I have a cool dataset!\n\n\n\nOutcome of dice rolls after 640 (left) and 2220 (right) rolls.\n\n\nI use the dataset for a little game: I show the outcomes after n rolls to my students in increments – the outcomes after a hundred rolls, a few hundred rolls, a thousand rolls, a few thousand rolls. After each presentation of the outcomes, I ask my students if they (still) believe the d20 is fair. When crossing the n=640 mark and the number 7 still has the lead (was rolled most often), several students start believing in a bias. Typically, only those with a background in mathematics and statistics continue to insist that we can’t confidently call this a bias yet. (I wonder if the blog post will change this. probably not; I doubt there’s an interest in reading your professor’s blog posts). Indeed, 7’s lead starts to disappear in later experiments, as it gets “diluted” by the new outcomes and is no longer conspicuous at n=2220.\nLet’s have a quick look at the statistics of it. If that doesn’t sound appealing, you can just skip this part. (If you are a student of mine, you better check it! 😏 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIs our d20 fair?\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert equations and fortran code\n  ! chi-squared test\n\n\n\nI wrote that 7’s lead gets “diluted” to stress that the probability of rolling a 7 in later experiments is not impacted by having rolled it more than the other numbers in earlier experiments. The ~equal number of rolls of each number on a fair die is not achieved by changes in the probability of rolling non-7’s to somehow make up for the difference. Instead, 7’s earlier lead is simply “diluted” by new, more balanced outcomes as n increases. For some reason, the first (false) explanation is often favoured by students (and non-students) before they are exposed to theory. Maybe it reflects our desire for a universe (or something) that intervenes with intention, because anything else would overwhelm us and fill us with existential dread? (I’m sure there’s some research on this). In any case, this persistent misunderstanding is but one of many indicators that leads us to the conclusion that humans do not have a good natural understanding of probability. I could go on about the misunderstanding of large and small numbers, the unintuitiveness of the independence of events, cognitive biases, and more. Instead, I’ll simply conclude the section as I started it: Probability isn’t intuitive."

    "text": "RainX\nMany urgent issues related to climate change, such as flooding, mass wasting, and water quality, are closely tied to rainfall extremes. Reliable predictions of extremes are, therefore, critical for risk management. Prediction of extremes, which is one of the main focuses of extreme value theory, is still considered one of the grand challenges by the World Climate Research Programme. This project will address this challenge by developing novel statistical, computationally efficient models that are able to predict rainfall extremes from the output of GPU-optimised climate models.\n\n\n\nFunder\nDuration\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nNERC\n3.5 years\nongoing\n\n\n\n\n\nExaGEO\nThe ExaGEO doctoral training programme delivers the next generation of Earth and environmental scientists trained in exascale computing.

GECO-21 (Glacial Ecology Changes in the 21st Century) addresses the question “How will glacial environments function when the glaciers are gone?”\n\n\n\nFunder\nDuration\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nNERC\n1+ years\nongoing\n\n\n\n\n\nQTiP\nThe BMBF research program “Central Asia: Monsoon dynamics and geoecosystems” and the project “Tipping points in the climate system and their consequences for Central Asia” focus on current research questions in the areas of climate change, geodynamics and georesources (including water) in interdisciplinary projects in international cooperation. An integrative systems approach is pursued here. The joint projects are to be understood as the German contribution to the large international R&D program “Third Pole Environment” (TPE) initiated by China, in which numerous nations are participating. The projects thus complement and integrate ongoing international and national geoscientific research projects in this region.\n\n\n\nFunder\nDuration\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nBMBF\n3 years\ncompleted\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL\nREAL is part of the priority programme 4DMB (4D Mountain Building) and focuses on reconstructing eastward propagation of surface uplift in the Alps by combining stable isotope palaeoaltimetry and clumped isotope (Δ47) derived temperature reconstructions with isotope-enabled General Circulation Models (GCMs).\n\n\n\nFunder\nDuration\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nDFG\n3 years\ncompleted\n\n\n\n\n\nAPE\nThe Alps Palaeoelevation/-climate Experiment (APE) is part of the priority programme 4DMB (4D Mountain Building).

    "section": "A game of dice",
    "text": "A game of dice\nProbability isn’t intuitive – this is a point I always make at the beginning of my series of lectures on statistics and probability theory. A few years ago, I invested in a (supposedly) perfectly balanced and fair d20 – that’s a 20 sided die (for those of you who haven’t played classic pen-and-paper role-playing games). I sometimes roll it and record the outcomes, because it relaxes me. I know, I have no life – but at least I have a cool dataset!\nI use the dataset for a little game: I show the outcomes after n rolls to my students in increments – the outcomes after a hundred rolls, a few hundred rolls, a thousand rolls, a few thousand rolls. After each presentation of the outcomes, I ask my students if they (still) believe the d20 is fair. When crossing the n=1000 mark and the number 7 still has the lead (was rolled most often), even those who weren’t troubled by 7’s earlier lead start believing in a bias. Typically, only those with a background in mathematics and statistics continue to insist that we can’t confidently call this a bias yet. Indeed, 7’s lead starts to disappear in later experiments, as it gets “diluted” by the new outcomes.\nLet’s have a quick look at the statistics of it. (Skip to the box if that doesn’t sound appealing to you.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteIs our d20 fair?\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert equations and fortran code\n  ! exponential distribution probability density function\n  ! with x=0.8 and lambda=0.5\n  fx = fsml_exp_pdf(0.8_dp, lambda=0.5_dp)\n  ! generalised Pareto cumulative distribution function\n  ! with modified shape (xi) and location (mu) parameters\n  fx = fsml_gpd_cdf(1.9_dp, xi=1.2_dp, mu=0.6_dp)\n\n\n\nI wrote that 7’s lead gets “diluted” to stress that the probability of rolling a 7 in later experiments is not impacted by having rolled it more than the other numbers in earlier experiments. The ~equal number of rolls of each number on a fair die is not achieved by changes in the probability of rolling non-7’s to make up for the many number of times 7 was rolled previously. Instead, 7’s earlier lead is simply “diluted” by new, more balanced outcomes as n increases. For some reason, the first (false) explanation is often favoured by students (and non-students) before they are exposed to theory. Maybe it reflects our desire for a universe (or something) that intervenes with intention, because anything else would overwhelm us and fill us with existential dread? (I’m sure there’s some research on this). In any case, this persistent misunderstanding demonstrates that we do not have a good natural ability to understand probability."

    "text": "Entangling probability and cost\n\nIf you wait here for a few more minutes, there is a 20% probability of missing the bus.\n\nSure, we don’t want to miss our bus, but it’s not the end of the world if we do. If it means we can socialise a some more with the friends we haven’t seen in a while, missing the bus will have been worth it. Besides, 20% isn’t that high. We will probably get it anyway, even if we stay for a little longer.\n\nIf you wait here for a few more minutes, there is a 20% probability of being hit by the bus.\n\n[I’m not sure how this would work, but let’s just accept the premise.]\nThe probability hasn’t changed, but our perception and assessment of it has, because there’s a risk of serious injury or death now. Suddenly, 20% is unreasonably high. That’s a higher probability than rolling a 6 on a 6-sided die!\nProbability is abstract. It’s the associated costs of an outcome that makes it seem less abstract and more understandable. However, what we think we understand isn’t probability, but probability entagled with tangible costs. What complicates this further is that costs always have a subjective component. Consider the following: Even if we can quantify costs as a monetary loss of 100€, these 100€ will be negligible to some and unbearably high to others, depending on their financial situation. Consequently, this will create vastly different perceptions or assessments of the probability associated with this loss.\nWhere does that leave us with communication of probabilities and associated events in general?\nIt’s unreasonable to expect to achieve widespread statistical literacy, so I don’t share some of my colleagues’ opinions that this is the solution – not that I would mind if it did happen. So if that’s not an option, how do we learn to effectively communicate probability and cost as a package? How do we account for subjective factors? How do we make costs tangible when most have not yet experienced what is to come?"

    "text": "RainX\nMany urgent issues related to climate change, such as flooding, mass wasting, and water quality, are closely tied to rainfall extremes. Reliable predictions of extremes are, therefore, critical for risk management. Prediction of extremes, which is one of the main focuses of extreme value theory, is still considered one of the grand challenges by the World Climate Research Programme. This project will address this challenge by developing novel statistical, computationally efficient models that are able to predict rainfall extremes from the output of GPU-optimised climate models.\n\n\n\nFunder\nDuration\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nNERC\n3.5 years\nongoing\n\n\n\n\n\nExaGEO\nThe ExaGEO doctoral training programme delivers the next generation of Earth and environmental scientists trained in exascale computing. ExaGEO is a holistic and multidisciplinary program targeting excellence in both the technical skills required for the development and application of software and multidisciplinary ‘domain’ training in the complexity of simulated Earth system processes.

GECO-21 (Glacial Ecology Changes in the 21st Century) addresses the question “How will glacial environments function when the glaciers are gone?”\n\n\n\nFunder\nDuration\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nNERC\n1+ years\nongoing\n\n\n\n\n\nQTiP\nThe BMBF research program “Central Asia: Monsoon dynamics and geoecosystems” and the project “Tipping points in the climate system and their consequences for Central Asia” focus on current research questions in the areas of climate change, geodynamics and georesources (including water) in interdisciplinary projects in international cooperation. An integrative systems approach is pursued here. The joint projects are to be understood as the German contribution to the large international R&D program “Third Pole Environment” (TPE) initiated by China, in which numerous nations are participating. The projects thus complement and integrate ongoing international and national geoscientific research projects in this region.\n\n\n\nFunder\nDuration\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nBMBF\n3 years\ncompleted\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL\nREAL is part of the priority programme 4DMB (4D Mountain Building) and focuses on reconstructing eastward propagation of surface uplift in the Alps by combining stable isotope palaeoaltimetry and clumped isotope (Δ47) derived temperature reconstructions with isotope-enabled General Circulation Models (GCMs).\n\n\n\nFunder\nDuration\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nDFG\n3 years\ncompleted\n\n\n\n\n\nAPE\nThe Alps Palaeoelevation/-climate Experiment (APE) is part of the priority programme 4DMB (4D Mountain Building).

I also model and predict the impacts that climate change has and will have on glaciers, extreme weather, and more. I employ theory-driven and data-driven (statistical and machine learning) models on different hardware – from single-board computers to petaflops supercomputers and GPU-based clusters. Find out more on the Climate Dynamics Lab website.\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Scientific Computing\n\n\n\n\nI develop research tools, numerical models, and teaching materials in modern Fortran and Python. Sustainability, accessibility, and ethics are key considerations. Consequently, all developed code and resources are open-access and open-source, and Fortran is used when reliability, performance, and energy efficiency are important.

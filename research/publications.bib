abstract = {Previous studies found depletion of precipitation 18O (18Op) during the late or post Asian monsoon season when precipitation amount is much lower. This is inconsistent with the amount effect of precipitation isotopes commonly found in tropical regions. It is still unclear whether this late/post season abnormal 18Op depletion also occurs in other monsoon regions, and what are the possible underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we examined seasonal variations of observed and modeled isotopic composition in precipitation (δ18Op) across the global monsoon regions, and their relationship with atmospheric circulations. We found that this abnormal 18Op depletion occurs in all monsoon regions globally, and it is largely caused by strong rainout along the global trade wind moisture transport pathway. The finding suggests that tropical cyclones are not the only mechanism to deplete 18Op during the late or post monsoon seasons, as suggested by previous studies. We should interpret such low δ18O values in the high-resolution paleoclimate records with more caution.}

abstract = {Abstract This study presents an overview of the Late Cenozoic evolution of the West African Monsoon (WAM), and the associated changes in atmospheric dynamics and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation (δ18Op). This evolution is established by using the high-resolution isotope-enabled GCM ECHAM5-wiso to simulate the climatic responses to paleoenvironmental changes during the Mid-Holocene (MH), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and Mid-Pliocene (MP). The simulated responses are compared to a set of GCM outputs from Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 4 (PMIP4) to assess the added value of a high resolution and model consistency across different time periods. Results show WAM magnitudes and pattern changes that are consistent with PMIP4 models and proxy reconstructions. ECHAM5-wiso estimates the highest WAM intensification in the MH, with a precipitation increase of up to 150 mm/month reaching 25°N during the monsoon season. The WAM intensification in the MP estimated by ECHAM5-wiso (up to 80 mm/month) aligns with the mid-range of the PMIP4 estimates, while the LGM dryness magnitude matches most of the models. Despite an enhanced hydrological cycle in MP, MH simulations indicate a ∼50\% precipitation increase and a greater northward extent of WAM than the MP simulations. Strengthened conditions of the WAM in the MH and MP result from a pronounced meridional temperature gradient driving low-level westerly, Sahel-Sahara vegetation expansion, and a northward shift of the Africa Easterly Jet. The simulated δ18Op values patterns and their relationship with temperature and precipitation are non-stationarity over time, emphasizing the implications of assuming stationarity in proxy reconstruction transfer functions.},

abstract = {The northern South American landscape evolved in response to complex interactions between geodynamic processes, climate, and sea-level oscillations, culminating in formation of the Amazon River. Although the history of this drainage basin was investigated in previous studies, the controlling factors on its depositional environment before Amazon River formation remain elusive. Based on existing sedimentologic and paleontologic observations and new numerical models, we show that Andean mountain building, evolving climate, and eustatic sea-level oscillations controlled the transition from intermittent marine to lacustrine environmental conditions in Amazonia before the onset of the transcontinental river. Our numerical simulations show that the incorporation of an evolving climate contributed to the shortening of the time interval between the end of marine influence in Western Amazonia and the onset of the transcontinental Amazon River during the late Miocene. Additionally, our numerical scenarios indicate that sea-level oscillations created intermittent marine incursions in central and western Amazonia only when negative dynamic topography induced by mantle convection was taken into account. After the establishment of the transcontinental river, the numerical scenarios produced no further marine incursions in central and western Amazonia, despite continued sea-level oscillation. We propose that this environmental evolution influenced regional biodiversity and the sedimentation history in northern South America, and explains the formation and disappearance of aquatic environments before the onset of the transcontinental Amazon River.}

abstract = {Abstract The long-term extent of the Earth system response to anthropogenic interference remains uncertain. However, the geologic record offers insights into this problem as Earth has previously cycled between warm and cold intervals during the Phanerozoic. We present an updated compilation of surface temperature proxies for several key time intervals to reconstruct global temperature changes during the Cenozoic. Our data synthesis indicates that Earth’s surface slowly cooled by ca. 9°C during the early Paleogene to late Neogene and that continent-scale ice sheets developed after global temperature dropped to less than 10°C above preindustrial conditions. Slow cooling contrasts with the steep decrease in combined radiative forcing from past CO2 concentrations, solar luminosity, and ocean area, which was close to preindustrial levels even as Earth remained in a much warmer state. From this, we infer that the Earth system was less sensitive to greenhouse gas forcing for most of the Cenozoic and that sensitivity must have increased by at least a factor of 2 during the Plio-Pleistocene. Our results imply that slow feedbacks will raise global surface temperatures by more than 3°C in the coming millennia, even if anthropogenic forcing is stabilized at the present-day value (2 W/m2), and that their impact will diminish with further warming.},

abstract = {Abstract The Middle Miocene (15.99–11.65 Ma) of Europe witnessed major climatic, environmental, and vegetational change, yet we are lacking detailed reconstructions of Middle Miocene temperature and precipitation patterns over Europe. Here, we use a high-resolution (∼0.75°) isotope-enabled general circulation model (ECHAM5-wiso) with time-specific boundary conditions to investigate changes in temperature, precipitation, and δ18O in precipitation (δ18Op). Experiments were designed with variable elevation configurations of the European Alps and different atmospheric CO2 levels to examine the influence of Alpine elevation and global climate forcing on regional climate and δ18Op patterns. Modeling results are in agreement with available paleobotanical temperature data and with low-resolution Middle Miocene experiments of the Miocene Model Intercomparison Project (MioMIP1). However, simulated precipitation rates are 300–500 mm/yr lower in the Middle Miocene than for pre-industrial times for central Europe. This result is consistent with precipitation estimates from herpetological fossil assemblages, but contradicts precipitation estimates from paleobotanical data. We attribute the Middle Miocene precipitation change in Europe to shifts in large-scale pressure patterns in the North Atlantic and over Europe and associated changes in wind direction and humidity. We suggest that global climate forcing contributed to a maximum δ18Op change of ∼2‰ over high elevation (Alps) and ∼1‰ over low elevation regions. In contrast, we observe a maximum modeled δ18Op decrease of 8‰ across the Alpine orogen due to Alpine topography. However, the elevation-δ18Op lapse rate shallows in the Middle Miocene, leading to a possible underestimation of paleotopography when using present-day δ18Op—elevation relationships data for stable isotope paleoaltimetry studies.},

abstract = {Abstract The hydroclimate of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Central Asia (CA) plays a crucial role in sustaining surface water reservoirs and thus water resources in the respective regions. In this study, we investigate the changes in Asian hydroclimate and its driving forces during specific time intervals in the last 3 Ma. We conduct high-resolution (∼0.75° per grid cell) general circulation model ECHAM-5 experiments with boundary conditions for the mid-Pliocene (∼3 Ma), the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ∼21 ka), the mid-Holocene (∼6 ka), and the pre-industrial. Results suggest that seasonally relatively high precipitation rates (>1 mm day−1) were longer in the mid-Pliocene and shorter in the LGM, relative to the pre-industrial. We calculate different monsoon indices to detect changes in the intensity, strength and duration of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), South Asian summer monsoon (SASM), and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), and construct climatologies of mid-latitude high-level westerly jet (WJ) stream occurrences based on the ECHAM5 wind fields. Our results suggest that in warm periods (e.g., mid-Pliocene or interglacial), the WJ migrates northward earlier in the year (April) and reaches higher latitudes than in the pre-industrial, resulting in a wetter TP and CA. During cooler periods (e.g., LGM or glacial), the WJ migrates northward later in the year (June) and remains over lower latitudes, resulting in a drier TP and CA. Increased/decreased local precipitation in TP and CA for the mid-Pliocene/LGM experiments correlates strongly with (a) intensity, strength and duration of the EASM, SASM, and the ISM and (b) WJ latitudinal position.},

abstract = {Abstract The Qaidam Basin (QB) in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau held a megalake system during the Pliocene. Today, the lower elevations in the basin are hyperarid. To understand to what extent the climate plays a role in the maintenance of the megalake system during the Pliocene, we applied the Weather Research and Forecasting model for dynamical downscaling of ECHAM5 global climate simulations for the present day and the mid-Pliocene. When imposing the mid-Pliocene climate on the QB with its modern land surface settings, the annual water balance (), that is, the change in terrestrial water storage within the QB, increases. This positive imbalance of induced solely by the changes in the large-scale climate state would lead to a readjustment of lake extent, until a new equilibrium state is reached, where loss due to evaporation over lake areas compensates for the input by runoff and precipitation. Atmospheric water transport (AWT) analysis at each border of the QB reveals that this imbalance of is caused by stronger moisture influx across the western border in winter, spring, and autumn and weaker moisture out-flux across the eastern border in summer. These changes in AWT are associated with the strengthening of the midlatitude westerlies in all seasons, except for summer, and the intensification of the East Asian Summer Monsoon. Given that the mid-Pliocene climate is an analog to the projected warm climate of the near future, our study contributes to a better understanding of climate change impacts in central Asia.},

We do this using a high-resolution isotope tracking general circulation model (ECHAM5-wiso) and explore the precipitation δ18O (δ18Op) signal of Cenozoic paleoclimate and topographic change in the European Alps. Results predict a maximum δ18Op change of 4–5‰ (relative to present day) during topographic development of the Alps. This signal of topographic change has the same magnitude as changes in δ18Op values resulting from Pliocene and Last Glacial Maximum global climatic change. Despite the similar magnitude of the isotopic signals resulting from topographic and paleoclimate changes, their spatial patterns across central Europe differ. Our results suggest that an integration of paleoclimate modeling, multiproxy approaches, and low-elevation reference proxy records distal from an orogen improve topographic reconstructions.},

abstract = {Assessing paleo-climatic changes and the underlying driving mechanisms are an essential (and often poorly understood) first-step for understanding if natural variability in Earth's climate system from tectonic processes and orbital forcing could produce observed changes in surface processes. In this study, we take this first step of evaluating climate change in the Tibetan Plateau region for different distinct climate states. We do this using a high-resolution regional climate model parameterized for the Cenozoic rise of the Plateau and prominent Quaternary glacial and interglacial episodes. The main objective is to delimit the range of climate variability due to important natural drivers in the region by comparing climate changes during the main Cenozoic uplift period with climate anomalies during the last glacial maximum and the mid-Holocene optimum. This helps to interpret environmental changes documented by proxy data and to benchmark man-made climate changes expected during the 21st century. The innovative aspects of this study pertain to the use of a consistent high-resolution modeling framework and a multivariate statistical assessment of climate types and their shift during the various paleo-climatic episodes. Reduced plateau elevation leads to regionally differentiated patterns of higher temperature and lower precipitation amounts on the plateau itself, whereas surrounding regions are subject to colder conditions. In particular, Central Asia receives much more precipitation prior to the uplift, mainly due to a shift of the stationary wave train over Eurasia. Cluster analysis indicates that the continental-desert type climate, which is widespread over Central Asia today, appears with the Tibetan Plateau reaching 50% of its present-day elevation. The mid-Holocene is characterized by slightly colder temperatures, and the last glacial maximum by considerably colder conditions over most of central and southern Asia. Precipitation anomalies during these episodes are less pronounced and spatially heterogeneous over the Tibetan Plateau. The simulated changes are in good agreement with available paleo-climatic reconstructions from proxy data. The present-day climate classification is only slightly sensitive to the changed boundary conditions in the Quaternary. However, it is shown that in some regions of the Tibetan Plateau the climate anomalies during the Quaternary have been as strong as the changes occurring during the uplift period.}

abstract = {Abstract Variations in oxygen isotope compositions (δ18O) provide insight into modern climate and past changes in climate and topography. In addition, in regions such as Tibet, geologic archives of isotope ratios record climate change driven by plateau uplift and therefore also provide information about the surface uplift history. A good understanding of modern-day controls on δ18O is crucial for interpreting geologic δ18O in this context. We use the ECHAM5-wiso global atmospheric general circulation model to calculate δ18O in precipitation (δ18Op) for the present-day climate. In the region of the Tibetan Plateau, spatial variations of monthly means of δ18Op are statistically related to spatial variations of 2 m air temperature and precipitation rate, as well as to topography. The size and location of investigated regions are varied in our study to capture regional differences in these relationships and the processes governing the modern δ18Op. In addition to correlation analyses, a cross-validated stepwise multiple regression is carried out using δ18Op as the predictand, and topography and atmospheric variables (temperature and precipitation amount) as predictors. The 2 m air temperature and topography yield the highest spatial correlation coefficients of >0.9 and < −0.9, respectively, throughout most of the year. Particularly high correlation coefficients are calculated for the region along the Himalayan orogeny and parts of western China. The predictors explain >90\% of the δ18Op spatial variance in the same regions. The 2 m air temperature is the dominant predictor and contributes 93.6\% to the total explained spatial variance on average. The results demonstrate that most of the δ18Op pattern on and around the Tibetan Plateau can be explained by variation in 2 m air temperature and altitude. Correlation of the dependent predictors indicate that in low-altitude regions where topography does not determine temperature variability, the high correlation of temperature and δ18Op may partially be explained by variations in precipitation rates.},

abstract = {Abstract Variations in oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) measured from modern precipitation and geologic archives provide a promising tool for understanding modern and past climate dynamics and tracking elevation changes over geologic time. In areas of extreme topography, such as the Tibetan Plateau, the interpretation of δ18O has proven challenging. This study investigates the climate controls on temporal (daily and 6 h intervals) and spatial variations in present-day precipitation δ18O (δ18Op) across the Tibetan Plateau using a 30 year record produced from the European Centre/Hamburg ECHAM5-wiso global atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). Results indicate spatial and temporal agreement between model-predicted δ18Op and observations. Large daily δ18Op variations of −25 to +5‰ occur over the Tibetan Plateau throughout the 30 simulation years, along with interannual δ18Op variations of ~2‰. Analysis of extreme daily δ18Op indicates that extreme low values coincide with extreme highs in precipitation amount. During the summer, monsoon vapor transport from the north and southwest of the plateau generally corresponds with high δ18Op, whereas vapor transport from the Indian Ocean corresponds with average to low δ18Op. Thus, vapor source variations are one important cause of the spatial-temporal differences in δ18Op. Comparison of GCM and Rayleigh Distillation Model (RDM)-predicted δ18Op indicates a modest agreement for the Himalaya region (averaged over 86°–94°E), confirming application of the simpler RDM approach for estimating δ18Op lapse rates across Himalaya.},

abstract = {The Himalaya–Tibet orogen contains one of the largest modern topographic and climate gradients on Earth. Proxy data from the region provide a basis for understanding Tibetan Plateau paleo climate and paleo elevation reconstructions. Paleo climate model comparisons to proxy data compliment sparsely located data and can improve climate reconstructions. This study investigates temporal changes in precipitation, temperature and precipitation δO18(δOp18) over the Himalaya–Tibet from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present. We conduct a series of atmospheric General Circulation Model (GCM, ECHAM5-wiso) experiments at discrete time slices including a Pre-industrial (PI, Pre-1850 AD), Mid Holocene (MH, 6 ka BP) and LGM (21 ka BP) simulations. Model predictions are compared with existing proxy records. Model results show muted climate changes across the plateau during the MH and larger changes occurring during the LGM. During the LGM surface temperatures are ∼2.0–4.0°C lower across the Himalaya and Tibet, and >5.0 °C lower at the northwest and northeast edge of the Tibetan Plateau. LGM mean annual precipitation is 200–600 mm/yr lower over on the Tibetan Plateau. Model and proxy data comparison shows a good agreement for the LGM, but large differences for the MH. Large differences are also present between MH proxy studies near each other. The precipitation weighted annual mean δ18Op lapse rate at the Himalaya is about 0.4‰/km larger during the MH and 0.2‰/km smaller during the LGM than during the PI. Finally, rainfall associated with the continental Indian monsoon (between 70°E–110°E and 10°N–30°N) is about 44% less in the LGM than during PI times. The LGM monsoon period is about one month shorter than in PI times. Taken together, these results document significant spatial and temporal changes in temperature, precipitation, and δ18Op over the last ∼21 ka. These changes are large enough to impact interpretations of proxy data and the intensity of the Indian monsoon.}

abstract = {Previous studies related to the active deformation within the India-Asia collision zone have relied on slip rate data from major faults to test kinematic models for the region. However, estimated geodetic and Quaternary slip rates demonstrate large variability for many of the major faults in the region (e.g., Altyn Tagh and Karakorum faults). As a result, several studies have challenged the assumption that geodetic slip rates are representative of Quaternary slip rates. In this review, slip rate data from the Quaternary fault database for Central Asia are used to determine the overall relationship between Quaternary and Global Positioning System (GPS) slip rates for 19 faults. A least squares and Pearson correlation analysis are applied to investigate this relationship. To evaluate the sensitivity of the slip rate relationship to the presence/absence of individual faults and different Quaternary dating methods, the slip rates were systematically re-sampled. To account for the range of published uncertainties for slip rates, the Monte Carlo method was applied. Regression through 57 Quaternary/GPS slip rate pairs yields an r2 value of 0.71. Results from the re-sampling analysis show that the inclusion or exclusion of slip rate data from specific faults (e.g., the Ganzi fault, Karakorum fault, Himalayan Main Frontal thrust and Main Pamir thrust) have the highest influence on the strength of the correlation (changing the Pearson correlation coefficient by +0.08, +0.05, −0.06, and +0.06, respectively). Furthermore, there appears to be a systematic bias in the agreement between rates such that Quaternary rates tend to be higher than GPS rates. This bias is likely due to assumptions embedded in the geomorphic reconstructions of offset landforms used for estimating Quaternary slip rates in the dataset. Taken together, these results suggest that GPS slip rates are more likely to represent Quaternary slip rates when strict fault selection and geomorphic dating criteria are applied. Cases of inconsistencies in slip rates over different time scales may point to differences in the sensitivity of various fault slip measurement methods more often than secular rate changes.}

The [course website](http://integrate.mutz.science) for INTEGRATE (INTEGRation of Atmospheric science, Technical and Empirical methods) comprises a climate science mini-primer ("Building a Climate") that introduces the fundamental concepts of climate science as well as the primary controls on Earth's climate system. The exercise series comprise a crash course in coding (with Python) and practical problems that allow you to apply your knowledge of statistics to real problems in climate science. The source code (incl. all solutions for the exercises) is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastian-mutz/integrate).

The ParsQuake video series for emergency Earthquake education are designed to equip you with important scientific and pracitcal knowledge to help you protect yourself and your community in the event of an earthquake. Our curriculum consists of pre- and post-assessment activities, six directed inquiry-based science activities describing physical processes related to earthquakes, five interactive activities on earthquake hazards and mitigation strategies, and a codification art/literacy project. The videos and accompanying materials are availble through the [ParsQuake website](https://parsquake.org/).

In this course, students have "the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of how decisions are made under uncertainty, and how communicating uncertainty effectively can help with making more informed decisions even when the outcomes are not fully predictable." [S. Mohadjer]. The course was offered through Global Awareness Education, as part of the [Transdisciplinary Course Program and Career Service (TRACS)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/facilities/administration/iii-academic-affairs/transdisciplinary-course-program-and-career-service/)

This is the core geological and geomorphological mapping course of the department of geosciences. Students get a 3-day mapping crash course in Catalonia, followed by a 2-week mapping project in the province of Teruel, Spain. The course is taught in German and English, and offered as a complete field course and a hybrid (semi-digital) version.
